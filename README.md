# webpack-service-worker-demo

Demo app built by following webpack 5's [Progressive Web Application](https://webpack.js.org/guides/progressive-web-application/)
guide.

Motivation is to get [auspice.us working offline](https://github.com/nextstrain/auspice.us/issues/62).

The demo app has been augmented with further intricaces (e.g. Express.js) in
hopes to understand why following the steps in the guide as-is does not work for
Auspice.
